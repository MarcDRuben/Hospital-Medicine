**This repository describes the workflow (with code) for leveraging electronic medical record (EMR) data to study treatment and response as a function of time-of-day**

## Background

We analyzed the daily distribution of ~120K doses of 12 separate drugs in ~1.5K inpatients at a major childrenâ€™s hospital in the U.S. Treatment orders and first-doses administered were strongly time-of-day-dependent (figure below). These 24 h rhythms were consistent across drugs, diagnoses, and hospital units. <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/617944v1>

Steps below describe how to reproduce these types of analyses.

## Part 1. Extract EMR data from Epic
Schematic (below) shows how EMR data in Epic moves from Chronicles, to Clarity, to divisional data mart. Code will need to be adapted to institutional differences in how Epic data is maintained.

## Part 2. Evaluate 24 h patterns in TREATMENT
Characterize the daily distribution of treatment orders and first-doses administered. Requires R.

## Part 3. Evaluate 24 h patterns in RESPONSE
Characterize clinical responses as a function of time of day. Requires R.
