In a recent study <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/617944v1>  we analyzed the daily distribution of ~120K doses of 12 separate drugs in ~1.5K inpatients at a major childrenâ€™s hospital in the U.S. Treatment orders and administration (first-doses) were strongly time-of-day-dependent. These 24 h rhythms were consistent across drugs, diagnoses, and hospital units.
