In a study <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/617944v1>  we analyzed the daily distribution of ~120K doses of 12 separate drugs in ~1.5K inpatients at a major childrenâ€™s hospital in the U.S. Treatment orders and administration (first-doses) were strongly time-of-day-dependent. These 24 h rhythms were consistent across drugs, diagnoses, and hospital units.

**This repository contains the code used for each part of this study.**

## Part 1. Extract EMR data from Epic
Extract patient EMR data from Epic. Requires SQL. Code may need to be adapted to institutional differences in Epic.

## Part 2. Evaluate 24 h patterns in TREATMENT
Characterize the daily distribution of treatment orders and first-doses administered. Requires R.

## Part 3. Evaluate 24 h patterns in RESPONSE
Characterize the clinical response to hydralazine, an acutely administered antihypertensive, as a function of time of day. Requires R.
